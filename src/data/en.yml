    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h4>Corporate Background</h4>
    <p>UNDP works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to achieve the eradication of poverty, and the reduction of inequalities and exclusion. We help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results.<br />UNDP is working to strengthen new frameworks for development, disaster risk reduction and climate change. We support countries' efforts to achieve the new Sustainable Development Goals, which will guide global development priorities through 2030. The key 2030 Agenda principle of leaving no one behind and stamping out inequality is at the core of everything we do.</p>
    <p>UNDP focuses on helping countries build and share solutions in three main areas:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sustainable development</li>
    <li>Democratic governance and peacebuilding</li>
    <li>Climate and disaster resilience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In all our activities, we encourage the protection of human rights and the empowerment of women, minorities and the poorest and most vulnerable.</p>
    <h4>Internship office background</h4>
    <p>UNDP is the knowledge frontier organization for sustainable development in the UN Development System and serves as the integrator for collective action to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNDP&rsquo;s policy work is carried out at HQ, Regional and Country Office levels, and forms a contiguous spectrum of deep local knowledge to cutting-edge global perspectives and advocacy. In this context, UNDP invests in the Global Policy Network (GPN), a network of field-based and global technical expertise across a wide range of knowledge domains. Governance and Peacebuilding (GP) Team in the Bangkok Regional Hub (BRH) working in the Asia Pacific Region is one of them.</p>
    <p>GP Team in BRH closely work with the UNDP&rsquo;s Crisis Bureau&rsquo;s relevant teams in the HQ as well as in other offices, and in collaboration with other specialists in Regional Hubs, HQ, Country Offices and the Oslo Governance Global Policy Center. The CP team in BRH is responsible for contributing substantive policy and programme advisory services to multiple Asia-Pacific Country Offices and applying products and tools relevant to the thematic area. Working to ensure quality and coherent policy and programme advisory services, it advances the credibility and recognition of the organization&rsquo;s programmes in this thematic area.</p>
    <p>In this context, the team seeks the services of a Knowledge Management Intern to take stock of the peacebuilding and conflict prevention work in the region and support drafting a knowledge product to better document and share knowledge in the region. Key areas of focus in this area include sustaining peace, peacebuilding, working in situations of protracted conflict, dealing with the past and promoting social cohesion, conflict and gender-sensitivity, and preventing violent extremism.</p>
